//Goal

Our goal is to create a blog front end. In this app, we should have a Login Page, a Create Account Page, Dashboard Page, & a Display Blog Page.

        The user will enter a username and password to login to the application. 
    
    Create Account Page:
        If the user does not have a login, this page will be used to handle creating an account.

        Add blog items
        See all blog the items
        Edit all blog items
        Delete blog items
